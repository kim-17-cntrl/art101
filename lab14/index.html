                <div id="problem"> I didn't have any issues with any of my older labs but most of the people on stack overflow were asking very complex questions that I didn't know. There was only one person that I was able to help. </div>

                <p>This is the question that was asked. I put it into my JavaScript file to work on it. They didn't have a lot of details in their request so I changed quite a bit, but tried to keep some of their original code. I added the functions to make the add more and average buttons function as they wanted. I also had to change their original add_more function a bit to get it to work properly. While it wasn't really a debugging and more coding I think I was still able to practice debugging as their original code had a few errors still. Here are the final results of my changes to their code:</p>
                <input type="text" id="result">
                <br> <br>
                <button onclick="add_more()">Add</button>
                <button onclick="average()">Average</button>
                <div id="output"></div>
        </div>
