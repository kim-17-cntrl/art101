			<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to practice defining variables in JavaScript and sing other commands to view the output of our code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose while working on this lab was how add photos to the lab. I always forget how I did it in previous labs, so I struggle with adding images each time. I also struggled a bit to get the output to be shown on my site. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think I did well in this lab. I was able to get the variables and commands to work properly. Here are some screenshots of me working on this lab: </p>
