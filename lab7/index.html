                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The goal of this lab was to write a function that takes the users name and sorts it alphabetically.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>Some problems that I ran into were that my function was not printing to my website properly. I think it was a problem with my code and I fixed it eventually. I also ran into the issue that my name wasn't being sorted. I think this issue was that it was sorting words and not the individual letters. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>I think I did well as I eventually got it to work with a lot of trial and error. 
                        Anyways here are the results from my JavaScript file:</p>
